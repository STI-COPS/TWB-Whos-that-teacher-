                <p>
                    Alias "Baby Josh" is an ICT Teacher at STI San Pablo Branch, he is one of the tertiary 
                    teachers there. Here is his short biography. <br><br>

    When he was a child, baby josh has really no plans on being a tertiary teacher or even a teacher at all,
     he doesn't see his self teaching anything. He dreamht on being a police man but that quickly faded when 
     he started to go to school. <br><br>
       
   Baby Josh  was an average student throughout his elem and junior year, his grades were never a problem and 
   he never got any low grades but when he was in college he started to be stressed out when he was learning 
   programming. He was bored and he didn't seem interested in the subject, but he got challenged and motivated
    when his teacher said to him that if he's not happy on what he is doing he should just stop and that's where
     baby Josh started to take programming seriously and that's where his story of being a teacher started. <br><br>

    When he became a teacher, he never received any negative feedbacks from his class because in his words he 
    was a friendly teacher and was never strict to his students.<br><br>

    He never stopped learning on things. He became a tourism teacher and handled other subjects too, it was one 
    of his greatest achievements because even though he was an ICT teacher he still handled different subjects.
