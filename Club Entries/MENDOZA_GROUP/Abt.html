                I'm a Science Teacher major in Biological Science.<br> In STI I'm teaching 3 subjects:<br>
                 Biological Science, Genereal Physics, Physical Science.<br> And I do motivate my students.<br>
                  I tell them encouraging words.<br> Like, "that they can do it"; "I believe in them";<br>
                   "They here because they are capable of being here".<br>
                    As a teacher my definition of success is that<br> I know my students are enjoying and learning
                     in my subject.<br> I wish I knew before I taught is <br>how to handle different type of people.<br>
                      Because some students are very different.<br> I'm a lazy worker, but I value time so much.<br>
                       To the point that if I need to finish something<br> I need to make sure that
                        I will finish it on time.

            Hello everyone, my name is Jainel Ariaga.<br> My nickname is Jane or Jai <br> (it depends on the perso
                n who I am talking with.)<br> Lastly my age is 24. My hobby is watching series in Netflix.<br>

                <br>My strength in the field of teaching is <br> I'm getting along with the students,<br> and 
                I always do fun-talk to my class<br> to make sure they did not get bored.<br> My weakness is I'm s
                uch a very sensitive person,<br> I don't like people when they are lying to me.<br> And I have this 
                trust issues.<br> I do value my family, friends, God, and time in my life.<br> I'm happy when someo
                ne value me more than I value myself.<br> I'm sad when people lie to me,<br> specially those people
                 whom I trust or very close to me.<br> In my life I've never been angry,<br> I always have a hard fe
                 eling for them.<br> However, I get angry if someone lies to me<br> after giving them many chances.<br>
