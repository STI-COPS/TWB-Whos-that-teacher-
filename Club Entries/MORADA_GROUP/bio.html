    Cedrick David Isleta was born in July 8 2000 (22 years old). He lives in Rizal, Laguna. 
    He Graduated from Dalubhasaan ng Lungsod ng San Pablo but now it’s called Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng San 
    Pablo. He is currently a Teacher at Systems Technology Institute (STI) San Pablo. He’s not currently 
    dating someone because he thinks it’s too early for him. Therefore, he’s focused on achieving his goals 
    in life. In his elementary days he didn’t imagined himself of being a teacher someday. He said that being 
    a 
    teacher wasn’t part of dream but when he experienced teaching, he grew fond of it and became a teacher.
