    Cedrick David Isleta stated that it is too early for him to have regrets in his life. 
    His motivation in life is his parents and family. He also stated that one of his inspiration comes 
    from the lord and savior Jesus Christ. He can also read the environment, mood, and atmosphere of the 
    situation and that’s what makes him different from the others. “What makes ME, ME is my mistakes and 
    experiences in life and accepted my mistakes and improve myself with it. I just go with the flow with my
     experiences and that’s what makes me, me”.  One of 
    his motto came from a bible verse, and that is “I will never leave you nor forsake you” (Joshua 1:9).
